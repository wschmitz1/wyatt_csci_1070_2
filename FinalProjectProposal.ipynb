There are 43 columns in this dataset, so I have already begun to highlight which columns I would like to remove.

Ultimately some of this big ones I see using are linear and logistic regression to help me shed light on the assumptions I make about the model. Of course, for logistic regression, this means I will have to convert some of the data into binary results. I also see myself playing with K Nearest Neighbor. "
